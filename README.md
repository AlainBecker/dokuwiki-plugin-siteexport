Dokuwiki Site Export
====================

Site Export is an admin plugin that offers a convenient way to download your dokuwiki site as a standalone version. It cycles through your namespaces - a starting point can be given at run-time - and packs the result into a zip file.
The result can be unpacked at any place and viewed without having an internet connection. That makes the plugin perfect for providing static documentation to customers on a CD or DVD.

**Attention:** You have to have the [zip compression library of your php](http://de.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) installation activated.
